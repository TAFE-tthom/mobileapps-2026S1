# Mobile Application Development - 2

## Courses

The subject and schedule is associated with the courses:

* Diploma of Information Technology (Advanced Programming)


## Sections

The following are sections are covered by this subject and relate to units of competency associated with the course. Each section description provides a brief-overview of what is covered and the learning outcomes.

* Data Structures

This section goes over fundamental data structures and construction of them. In conjunction to constructing these data structures, this section will also provide training in appropriate selection and usage of data structures given a domain/problem and how it can be combined with application development.

* Mobile-Application Development

Application development is a practical component which will involve developing contemporary software applications with existing frameworks such as ASP.NET, Entity Framework and Databases. In addition, design patterns, concurrency and network programming fundamentals are core to this section and developing a variety of software. Lastly, testing methods and software quality assurance will be integrated within here.

Within software development we may need to dive into developing applications that are become more aware about the system that they will be deployed and use. This will include system administration, developer operations, concurrecy and parallelism, inter-process communication, shared memory and software introspection. 


* Project

This course requires a final project to be developed as part of a group. Groups will be between 2 to 4 members, each project will go through slightly less than 12 weeks of development along with the software development lifecycle. Groups will provide a summary on sprints in the last term for evidence of project progression.
